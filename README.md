# Interactive SEIR disease model

This repository contains an interactive SEIR model with a try to match Cornavirus data from Italy.

Data from Italy are plotted in black.

Please note that I am not epidemiologist, the parameters might be wrong and the actions for containements are not taken into account  ..
If some epidemilogits could validate and contribute to this work .. it would be great !
Poeple need to know where we are going !

It is based on a work done by robmoss (https://github.com/robmoss/seir-demo) 
with default parameters set to match data from Italy.
